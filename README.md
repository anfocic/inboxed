> 🚪 Currently under active development. Not production ready yet.

### 🎯 Goal

To make a **zero-login**, plug-and-play form handler that:

* ✅ Accepts POST requests from any frontend (HTML, React, static sites, etc.)
* 📧 Delivers submitted form data directly to an email address
* 🔐 Requires no user accounts or dashboards
* ⚒️ Works as a lightweight drop-in microservice or Docker container

---

### 🧹 Planned Features

* ⚙️ Configurable via environment variables
* 🐳 Docker support for easy deployment
* 🛆 npm package (maybe) for dev integration
* 📩 Webhook and file support (future)
